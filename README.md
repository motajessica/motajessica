### Hi there 👋 

I am @motajessica (Jessica Mota) from Brazil 🇧🇷 and living in New Zealand 🇳🇿 since 2019. 

🙋‍♀️ I am a software developer (focus on full Stack Development & DevOps) with a background in mechanical engineering 🛠. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

🔭 Currently, I'm enrolled in the Mission Ready HQ Advanced Software Developer Program, where I'm improving my coding skills and expanding my knowledge of cloud and DevOps technologies.

💻 My tech stack: Node.js, React, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, MongoDB, CI/CD Deployment, TDD & Docker.

🌱 I'm always happy to learn and explore new technologies. Currently, I'm learning cloud infrastructure using Google Cloud, MongoDB, and Azure. I'm also interested in containerization with Docker and CI/CD workflows.

🚀 Some of my projects includes:
✔ My Journal App: Created an app with CRUD operations with data stored in MongoDB and implemented Google authentication. 
✔  Chatbot Integration: Trained a Google Dialog Flow AI model and integrated it into a web application as a chatbot assistant.
✔ Image Recognition App: Utilized Azure Custom Vision AI model to create an image recognition application, allowing users to find similar cars based on uploaded pictures.
✔ Web Application Deployment: Built and deployed a web application using Docker containers, enhancing my understanding of containerization and deployment strategies.

⚡ Fun facts: 
    -When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors and going on hikings🏕🥾/pedals🚴‍♀️. Nature a great way to recharge.
    -I love going to the GYM 🏋️‍♀️. I exercise almost everyday.
    -I play futsal once a week ⚽ ( even not being great at it ) and table tennis 🏓.

👯 I'm excited about software development, and I'm looking forward to contributing to open-source projects and exploring new possibilities in the tech world.

Happy coding! 🚀
